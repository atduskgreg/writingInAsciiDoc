= Maker Press

== Introduction
This document describes the workflow for Maker Press, an experimental system for building high quality, commercial documentation for projects for MAKE. Here's the basic idea:

* Editors sign an author to document a project
* The author writes the content in AsciiDoc, a text document format for writing documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs.
* The author, editor, and any interested contributor (more on this in a second) develop and maintain the content in git and github.
* When the content is ready, the author or editor moves it into the O'Reilly publishing workflow so that it can be pushed out through out digital channels

This document walks you through the process.

== Introduction
This document describes the workflow for Maker Press, an experimental system for building high quality, commercial documentation for projects for MAKE. Here's the basic idea:

* Editors sign an author to document a project
* The author writes the content in AsciiDoc, a text document format for writing documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs.
* The author, editor, and any interested contributor (more on this in a second) develop and maintain the content in git and github.
* When the content is ready, the author or editor moves it into the O'Reilly publishing workflow so that it can be pushed out through out digital channels

Although this document is intended mainly for authors, anyone can contribute to a Maker Press project by:

* Setting up a github account (if you don't have one)
* Fork the project into your own repo
* Pull down the repo into your own git repository
* Create a working branch and making some changes / edits
* Push your changes back up into your repo
* Send the author a pull request so that they will know you have something you want them to review
* The author will incorporate your changes as he or she sees fit

This document walks you through the process.

== Setting up your editing Environment

This doc describes how to set up an environment on a Mac to write for Maker Press.  (Or, I should say, it's my running notes for it!)  Depending on your system, you might have a bit of work to do to get things up and going.  So, take this document with a grain of salt!

We'll need to do a few things to get going:

* Install MacPorts to make it easy to get new packages
* Install git and asciidoc, which is a package for formatting text
* Install TextMate, as well as a few bundles

The following sections explain this in more detail.

== Preliminaries

You will need the XCode development tools and X11 (which comes on some Macs).  Next, you'll need MacPorts, which makes it much easier to install everything you'll need.  You can find it at the http://www.macports.org/install.php[MacPorts] website, which has all the instructions you need to install it for your system.

[[NOTE]]
----
One annoyance I had on MacPorts is that it lists the OS versions by name, rather than number, which I found annoying.  You can find your OS version by clicking the Apple at the top left corner and then selecting "About this Mac" and then find the corresponding name using the list below (from Wikipedia):

* Version 10.0: "Cheetah"
* Version 10.1: "Puma"
* Version 10.2: "Jaguar"
* Version 10.3: "Panther"
* Version 10.4: "Tiger"
* Version 10.5: "Leopard"
* Version 10.6: "Snow Leopard"
* Version 10.7: "Lion"
----

Then make sure your PATH is correct in ~/.profile. So here are the two lines you'll want (updating for your username):

----
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Applications:/Applications/Utilities:/usr/local/bin:/Users/adam/bin
export PATH
----

== Git

If you don't already have git, you can use MacPorts to install it.  Just drop into the terminal and type:

----
$ sudo port install git
----

It should fire up and install with no problems.

=== asciidoc, a2x (8.6.4) 
Asciidoc refers to two different things: a wiki-like *markup language* you can write in, and the various *tools* that convert that markup into various other formats.  This section describes how to set up the tools.  You can probably already see the punchline coming, but here's how you set up the asciidoc tools on your system:

----
$sudo port install asciidoc
----

The downside of this is that this step takes a *very* long time -- maybe an hour or so.  So, be prepared to run it and then go out and get some coffee.  Or, two coffees.

== Textmate
You can edit your documents in whatever editor you like -- vi, emacs, or whatever.  I've been using http://macromates.com/[TextMate], an editor for the Mac that is really popular in the developer community.  It's not free (it costs about $60 U.S.), but it's got some addictive features that make it worth the price.  You can download a 30 day free trial and try it out.  

TextMate has a variety of _bundles_ -- collections of macros, commands, snippets, drag commands, templates, preferences, and language grammars -- that make development much quicker.



=== Install the asciidoc bundle

Once you have it, you can also install something  a bundle to make AsciiDoc work easier in textmate.  Here's what you do:

----
mkdir -p /Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles   
cd ~/"Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/"
git clone git://github.com/zuckschwerdt/asciidoc.tmbundle.git "AsciiDoc.tmbundle"
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
----

=== The git bundle

You can also set up a git bundle in textmate by doing these commands.  Not sure what this buys me yet, but here are the commands:

----
mkdir -p /Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
cd !$
git clone http://git.gitorious.org/git-tmbundle/mainline.git Git.tmbundle
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
----
Finally, you'll need to add a path variable to tell TextMate where git is installed.  Go to "Preferences -> Advanced" and click the "Shell Variables" tab.  Then add a variable named "TM_GIT".  You can find the path to git using this command sequence:

----
$which git
/usr/local/git/bin/git 
----


You can open all the files in a directory using the command *mate .*.  That will open the editor and also display a nav tree where you can navigate files.

Once you have TextMate, there are a couple of bundles (these are like macro command packages) that you can install.  These make life much easier for editing.

=== Useful Links
I'm following http://www.apeth.net/matt/iosbooktoolchain.html[Matt Neuburg article on how to write a book using asciidoc], but I want to do it with git, instead.  Here's the link to his article:


BTW, here's a nifty doc on AsciiDoc: http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[Asciidoc cheat sheet]

= Setting up your editing Environment
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.

This doc describes how to set up an environment on a Mac to write for Maker Press.  (Or, I should say, it's my running notes for it!)  Depending on your system, you might have a bit of work to do to get things up and going.  So, take this document with a grain of salt!

We'll need to do a few things to get going:

* Install MacPorts to make it easy to get new packages
* Install git and asciidoc, which is a package for formatting text
* Install TextMate, as well as a few bundles

The following sections explain this in more detail.

=== Preliminaries
You will need the XCode development tools and X11 (which comes on some Macs).  Next, you'll need MacPorts, which makes it much easier to install everything you'll need.  You can find it here:

http://www.macports.org/install.php[MacPorts]

[[NOTE]]
----
One annoyance I had on MacPorts is that it lists the OS versions by name, rather than number, which I found annoying.  You can find your OS version by clicking the Apple at the top left corner and then selecting "About this Mac" and then find the corresponding name using the list below (from Wikipedia):

* Version 10.0: "Cheetah"
* Version 10.1: "Puma"
* Version 10.2: "Jaguar"
* Version 10.3: "Panther"
* Version 10.4: "Tiger"
* Version 10.5: "Leopard"
* Version 10.6: "Snow Leopard"
* Version 10.7: "Lion"
----

Then make sure your PATH is correct in ~/.profile. So here are the two lines you'll want (updating for your username):

----
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Applications:/Applications/Utilities:/usr/local/bin:/Users/adam/bin
export PATH
----

== Git

If you don't already have git, you can use MacPorts.  Drop into the terminal and type:

----
$ sudo port install git
----

It should fire up and install with no problems.

=== asciidoc, a2x (8.6.4)
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.  There are two parts: the markup language you'll be writing in, and the various tools to convert the markup into beaucoups of other formats.  This section describes how to set up the various tools.

----
$sudo port install asciidoc
----

This step takes a very long time.

Once that is done, you can follow the the AsciiDoc instructions. I just went ahead and installed it according to the "Running asciidoc from your local copy" instructions and didn't bother with the global install.



== Textmate
TextMate is an editor that people seem to really like on the mac.  Download it from here:

http://macromates.com/

You can open all the files in a directory using the command *mate .*.  That will open the editor and also display a nav tree where you can navigate files.

Once you have TextMate, there are a couple of bundles (these are like macro command packages) that you can install.  These make life much easier for editing.

=== Install the asciidoc bundle

Once you have it, you can also install something  a bundle to make AsciiDoc work easier in textmate.  Here's what you do:

----
mkdir -p /Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles   
cd ~/"Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/"
git clone git://github.com/zuckschwerdt/asciidoc.tmbundle.git "AsciiDoc.tmbundle"
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
----

On my system, there was a weird problem when the bundle editors tried to find the asciidoc command.  There's probably some environment variable or the other that I need to set, but here's what I did to fix it.  First, I located where MacPorts installed asciidoc, which you can do by dropping into a terminal and typing this:

----
$ which asciidoc

/opt/local/bin/asciidoc
----

Then go into the bundle editor (Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Show Bundle Editor) and select the asciidoc bundle.  You can then go into the commands (the have "c" in fromt of them) and add this path in front of everyplace where asciidoc appears.  For example, here's the revised version of the "Preview" command:

----
if [[ -z $TM_FILENAME ]]
  then doc="-"
  else doc="$TM_FILEPATH"
fi
/opt/local/bin/asciidoc --attribute=imagesdir="file://$(pwd)" --out-file - "$doc" 2>&1 | perl -pe 's%(\w+): .*?: line ([0-9]+):%<b style="color:red">$1</b>: <a href="txmt://open/?line=$2">line $2</a>:%g'
----

=== The git bundle

You can also set up a git bundle in textmate by doing these commands.  Not sure what this buys me yet, but here are the commands:

----
mkdir -p /Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
cd !$
git clone http://git.gitorious.org/git-tmbundle/mainline.git Git.tmbundle
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
----
Finally, you'll need to add a path variable to tell TextMate where git is installed.  Go to "Preferences -> Advanced" and click the "Shell Variables" tab.  Then add a variable named "TM_GIT".  You can find the path to git using this command sequence:

----
$which git
/usr/local/git/bin/git 
----


=== Useful Links
I'm following http://www.apeth.net/matt/iosbooktoolchain.html[Matt Neuburg article on how to write a book using asciidoc], but I want to do it with git, instead.  Here's the link to his article:


BTW, here's a nifty doc on AsciiDoc: http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[Asciidoc cheat sheet]

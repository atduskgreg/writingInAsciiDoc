== Useful links

These are various linke that I've found that help explain AsciiDoc, O'Reilly processes, and other stuff:

* http://www.apeth.net/matt/iosbooktoolchain.html[Matt Neuburg article on how to write a book using asciidoc].  Nice article that explains how to do lots of good stuff.
* http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[Asciidoc cheat sheet].  Pretty much what it says -- this shows you the markup in a no-nonsense kind of way.
* https://prod.oreilly.com/external/tools/docbook/docs/authoring/docbookguidelines_web.pdf[O'Reilly Production Guidelines].  Describes how to use the main O'Reilly subversion repository.
* http://ryanflorence.com/git-for-beginners/[Looks like a pretty good intor to the basic features of git]
